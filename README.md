# coding-cheatsheet
This is a Codecademy project aiming to create a cheat sheet for one HTML or CSS topic. I chose basic HTML tags for building a web page.
I would like to keep adding information such as CSS and Javascript because I have always learned best by doing things myself and creating reference sheets.
